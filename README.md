# Software
Well i'm trying to stay away from extra services like (mttq) and keep it ultra simpel so anybody can reproduce the with the minimal knowledge and a bit of googling. And yeah shure, there are way better ways, but this is more fun. Getting to know the stuf you make instead of just download and run straigth from the web.

# Why
Like most of my projects. Because I can. <br />
